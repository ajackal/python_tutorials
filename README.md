# Python Tutorials

A collection of tutorials to learn Python. Audience: anyone wanting to learn Python, no experince required.

## Setting up your Python Environment

1. Download and install __Python__. I would recommend Python _2.7_ because it has the best library support for penetration testing. While 2.7 is coming to end of life, most tools are still in the the process of migrating to Python 3.

2. Once Python is installed, I would recommend downloading and installing the _iPython_ interactive console `pip install iPython`. It is a much more full-featured interactive console and is much easier to use than the default Python console.

3. Download and install your prefered _text editor_ or _integrated development environment_ (IDE). There is no one perfect tool, and everyone has their preference. Below is a list of my favoriate and other popular tools that you can do your coding in. While you can do this tutorial and a lot of programming in a text editor, the more complicated your programs get, the more I recommend an IDE as it speeds up your development time and actually helps you learn more and faster. Don't be afraid to start with one program and experiment with others. You will learn which is your favorite by trying all of them.
	
	__Text Editors__:
		- Notepad ++ (personal favorite for Windows environment)
		- Vim (great for text editing, good for developing simple programs in Linux)
		- Emacs (a lot of people love it, peronally never used it, simliar to Vim)
	
	__Integrated Development Environments__ (IDEs):
		- PyCharm (personal favorite for all my Python program development, all platforms)
		- VScode (awesome IDE great for multi-language development, but not as good as PyCharm for Python alone)
		- Atom (also awesome IDE/text editor, similar to VScode, great for multi-language development)
		- Geany (good free IDE for Linux)
		
4. All lessons can be completed in one of two ways (or both!):
	
	1. In an interactive console: Open a terminal in your OS of choice and type either `python` or `ipython` to enter an interactive console. Great method for testing snippets of code while working on a large program. Nothing is saved, though iPython has a pretty good history (the 'up' arrow).
	
	2. An IDE/Text Editor. IDEs will have a built-in interactive console in their own interface that you can use to run the code that you have written (usually at the bottom of the IDE). Text Editors (like Notepad ++ & Vim) you will have to open a terminal or command prompt and execute the file with `python filename.py`
